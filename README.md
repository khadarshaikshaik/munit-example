# MUnit2 Short Tutorial

## Overview

This simple, short tutorial takes you through the process of creating a series of MUnit2 tests, which are aimed at validating the behavior of a simple code example.

This tutorial uses only core components of Mule ESB. No Anypoint Connectors are used; however, you can easily apply what you learn here to Anypoint Connectors.

## Sample Business Logic Code

The sample code for this tutorial is fairly simple, uses some of Mule's most common message processors. It implements the following basic use case:

1. It receives an HTTP request.
1. It extracts data from the request to route a message through the application.
1. It decides how to create a response.

*business-logic.xml*

``` xml
<mule xmlns:http="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http" xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core" ... >

	<http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_config" doc:name="HTTP Listener config" >
		<http:listener-connection host="0.0.0.0" port="${http.port}" />
	</http:listener-config>

	<configuration-properties file="mule-artifact.properties" doc:name="Configuration properties" />

	<flow name="mainFlow" >
		<http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_config" path="/" doc:name="HTTP Listener" allowedMethods="GET"/>
		<set-payload value="#[attributes.queryParams.url_key]" doc:name="Set query param 'url_key' to payload" />
		<flow-ref name="secondaryFlow" doc:name="secondaryFlow" />
		<choice doc:name="Choice" >
			<when expression="#[vars.flowValue == 'flowValue_1']" >
				<set-payload value="#['responsePayload_1']" doc:name="Set Response Payload" />
			</when>
			<otherwise >
				<set-payload value="#['responsePayload_2']" doc:name="Set Response Payload" />
			</otherwise>
		</choice>
	</flow>

	<flow name="secondaryFlow" >
		<choice doc:name="Choice" >
			<when expression="payload == 'payload_1'" >
				<flow-ref name="firstSubFlow" doc:name="firstSubFlow" />
			</when>
			<otherwise >
				<flow-ref name="secondSubFlow" doc:name="secondSubFlow" />
			</otherwise>
		</choice>
	</flow>
	
	<sub-flow name="firstSubFlow" >
		<set-variable variableName="flowValue" value="flowValue_1" doc:name="Set Variable"  />
	</sub-flow>

	<sub-flow name="secondSubFlow" >
		<set-variable variableName="flowValue" value="flowValue_2" doc:name="Set Variable" />
	</sub-flow>
</mule>
```

Let's analyze the above code by breaking it up into sections. The first section is the entry point of the application containing the HTTP listener. Here's how it works:

1. Receiving data from the HTTP request.
1. Calling the `secondaryFlow` for further processing
1. Based on the value of the invocation variable `flowValue` set by `secondaryFlow` returns either `responsePayload_1` or `responsePayload_2`

*mainFlow*

``` xml
<flow name="mainFlow" >
	<http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_config" path="/" doc:name="HTTP Listener" allowedMethods="GET"/>
	<set-payload value="#[attributes.queryParams.url_key]" doc:name="Set query param 'url_key' to payload" />
	<flow-ref name="secondaryFlow" doc:name="secondaryFlow" />
	<choice doc:name="Choice" >
		<when expression="#[vars.flowValue == 'flowValue_1']" >
			<set-payload value="#['responsePayload_1']" doc:name="Set Response Payload" />
		</when>
		<otherwise >
			<set-payload value="#['responsePayload_2']" doc:name="Set Response Payload" />
		</otherwise>
	</choice>
</flow>
```



The second part of the app, `secondaryFlow`, is basically for routing. It does not perform any real action over the message or its payload. Rather, it delegates that to two other subflows, based on the payload received as input. It works as follows:

1. Evaluate the payload that enters the flow
1. Make call to `firstSubFlow` if condition is fulfilled
1. Make call to `secondSubFlow` otherwise

*secondaryFlow*

``` xml
<flow name="secondaryFlow" >
	<choice doc:name="Choice" >
		<when expression="payload == 'payload_1'" >
		        <flow-ref name="firstSubFlow" doc:name="firstSubFlow" />
		</when>
		<otherwise >
			<flow-ref name="secondSubFlow" doc:name="secondSubFlow" />
		</otherwise>
	</choice>
</flow>
```

Finally we have two subflows whose only task is to set a value for an _invocation_ variable named `flowValue`.

*sub_Flow(s)*

``` xml
<sub-flow name="firstSubFlow" >
	<set-variable variableName="flowValue" value="flowValue_1" doc:name="Set Variable"  />
</sub-flow>

<sub-flow name="secondSubFlow" >
	<set-variable variableName="flowValue" value="flowValue_2" doc:name="Set Variable" />
</sub-flow>
```

## Creating Tests

When performing unit tests, it's always better to take a ground-up approach, first testing the building blocks of the code.

**TIP**: Always test the building blocks of your code first, then test the more complex code. You can compare this to setting the pillars and ensuring that they'll hold, before building the rest of the bridge.

We'll start by testing `secondaryFlow`.

Ideally, you should test each and every flow and sub-flow in your application, in order to validate that each one of them behaves as expected. Since we've complicated things a little in order to show you more scenarios, we'll skip testing the sub-flows. In a real application, we should start by testing those two sub-flows.


### MUnit Test Suit "Musts"

Each MUnit test file _must_ contain the following beans:

* `MUnit config`
* The _import section_

In the _import_ section, we define the files needed for this test to run. This section usually includes the file containing the flows we want to test, and additional files required for the first file to work. These are shown in the snippet below:

``` xml
<munit:config name="test-suite.xml" doc:name="MUnit configuration"/>
<import file="business-logic.xml" doc:name="Import" />
```

### Testing: `secondaryFlow`

This flow contains a `choice` router, which provides two different paths that the code can follow. Here we will explain how to test first of them. The second one is similar.

*secondaryFlow - First test case*

``` xml
<munit:test name="secondaryFlowTest_1" description="MUnit Test" >
	<munit:execution >
		<munit:set-event doc:name="Set Message payload == payload_1" >
			<munit:payload value="#['payload_1']" />
		</munit:set-event>
		<flow-ref name="secondaryFlow" doc:name="secondaryFlow" />
	</munit:execution>
	<munit:validation >
		<munit-tools:assert-that expression="#[vars.flowValue]" is="#[equalTo('flowValue_1')]" doc:name="Assert payload" />
		<munit-tools:verify-call processor="mule:flow-ref" doc:name="Verify call" times="1">
			<munit-tools:with-attributes>
				<munit-tools:with-attribute attributeName="name" whereValue="#['firstSubFlow']" />
			</munit-tools:with-attributes>
		</munit-tools:verify-call>
	</munit:validation>
</munit:test>
```

Here's how it works:

1. Define input message to be sent to the production flow `secondaryFlow`.
1. Make call to production code.
1. Verify the value of variable _flowValue_ is correct.
1. Verify the sub-flow 'firstSubFlow' was called exactly once.

This test looks fairly simple, but it has a few points to highlight.

The first thing we do is to create an input message. This is a very common scenario; you will probably have to create input messages for the flows that you'll test. In this example it was only necessary to define a payload, but further down in this tutorial we'll see how to create more complex messages.

For the purposes of this test, we can be confident that the code works properly by simply ensuring the variable that was supposed to be set is set to correct value and the correct message processor was called.

**WARNING**: In MUnit2 you mock or verify `flow-ref` not the `flow` and `sub-flow` as in MUnit1.


### Testing: `mainFlow`

This flow contains an `http-listener`, but in order to show you different scenarios we are not going to call it. Since we are not calling the HTTP listener, we need to take a few other actions for this test to work properly.

*mainFlow - Test case*

``` xml
<munit:test name="test_withMock_1" description="MUnit Test" >
	<munit:behavior >
		<munit-tools:mock-when processor="mule:set-payload" doc:name="Mock when" >
			<munit-tools:with-attributes >
				<munit-tools:with-attribute attributeName="doc:name" whereValue="#[&quot;Set query param 'url_key' to payload&quot;]" />
			</munit-tools:with-attributes>
			<munit-tools:then-return >
				<munit-tools:payload value="#['']" />
			</munit-tools:then-return>
		</munit-tools:mock-when>
		<munit-tools:mock-when processor="mule:flow-ref" doc:name="Mock when" >
			<munit-tools:with-attributes >
				<munit-tools:with-attribute attributeName="name" whereValue="#['secondaryFlow']" />
			</munit-tools:with-attributes>
			<munit-tools:then-return >
				<munit-tools:payload value="#['']" />
				<munit-tools:variables >
					<munit-tools:variable key="flowValue" value="#['flowValue_1']" />
				</munit-tools:variables>
			</munit-tools:then-return>
		</munit-tools:mock-when>
	</munit:behavior>
	<munit:execution >
		<flow-ref name="mainFlow" doc:name="mainFlow" />
	</munit:execution>
	<munit:validation >
		<munit-tools:assert-that expression="#[payload]" is="#[equalTo('responsePayload_1')]" doc:name="Assert that" />
	</munit:validation>
</munit:test>
```

Here's how it works:

1. Define mock for the set-payload message processor in `exampleFlow`.
1. Define mock for the call to `exampleFlow2`.
1. Make call to production code.
1. Validate success of the test by asserting the returned payload.

The first thing to notice in this test is that we are defining _mocks_. Mocks are what allow you to isolate your flow, distinguishing it from third-party systems and any other flows in your application.

The first mock we define is for the `set-payload` message processor. We do this because this message processor expects a certain set of inbound variables, but we won't send them in this test -- hence, for the code to succeed we need to mock the behavior of the `set-payload` message processor.

Notice that we are not actually returning a payload. The payload in the `set-payload` message processor is needed by `secondaryFlow`. In this unit test, we'll trust `secondaryFlow` to work as expected, and will mock it as well.

**TIP**: When doing unit tests, you isolate your flow from third-party systems and other flows and trust they will work as expected. In turn, you must test each third-party system or flow with its own, specific test.

If you've been reading this tutorial from the beginning, you already know that in MUnit2 you mock `flow-ref` message processors. That's what we're doing here, mocking `secondaryFlow`  flow reference which was called from `mainFlow`.

The purpose of `secondaryFlow` was to set the value of the invocation variable `flowValue`. If you look closely at this mock, you'll see that we are telling the mocked flow to return a message that contains an invocation variable named `flowValue` with a value of `flowValue_1`. This is what should happen in the first test scenario.

Now that our two mocks are in place, we'll run the production code:

``` xml
<flow-ref name="mainFlow" doc:name="mainFlow"/>
```

The only thing that remains to be done for this test is to define its success criteria. For the purposes of this example, we'll determine whether it was successful based on the payload returned by the flow.

``` xml
<munit-tools:assert-that expression="#[payload]" is="#[equalTo('responsePayload_1')]" doc:name="Assert that" />
```

As you can see, we are validating that the payload returned is equal to that set by the first branch of the choice in the production code, i.e. `'responsePayload_1`.

The other branches could be tested similarly.

### Functional Testing

All of the tests explained so far were unit tests, which try to isolate each flow as much as possible from the other flows.

You may also want to do a _functional test_, i.e. an end-to-end test. In our example, this means that we are not going to mock any message processor. To implement a test in this way, we need to correctly define the message that we'll send to the production code.

In previous tests, we mocked the first message processor of `mainFlow` because it needed the message to contain specific values. Since we are not mocking anything now, we will have to create that message.

*mainFlow - Functional test*

``` xml
<munit:test name="functionalTest_mainFlow_1" description="MUnit Test" >
	<munit:execution >
		<munit:set-event doc:name="Set Query Parameter url_key=payload_1" >
			<munit:payload value="#['']" />
			<munit:attributes value="#[{queryParams: {url_key: 'payload_1'}}]" />
		</munit:set-event>
		<flow-ref name="mainFlow" doc:name="mainFlow" />
	</munit:execution>
	<munit:validation >
		<munit-tools:assert-that expression="#[vars.flowValue]" is="#[equalTo('flowValue_1')]" doc:name="Assert payload" />
	</munit:validation>
</munit:test>
```

This test is very similar to the others for `mainFlow`, without the mocks. Let's check again the implementation of `mainFlow`, specifically the `set-payload`:

``` xml
<set-payload value="#[attributes.queryParams.url_key]" doc:name="Set query param 'url_key' to payload" />```

The `set-payload` message processor is expecting the message to have an attribute named `queryParams`, which should be a map. The map should contain the key `url_key`.

The code below shows how to create such a message:

``` xml
<munit:set-event doc:name="Set Query Parameter url_key=payload_1" >
	<munit:payload value="#['']" />
	<munit:attributes value="#[{queryParams: {url_key: 'payload_1'}}]" />
</munit:set-event>
```
